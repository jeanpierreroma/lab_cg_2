<!-- The mathematical basis of the problem of creating moving images in CG is affine transformations. According to the type of transformation function, linear and non-linear transformations are distinguished. It is convenient to write linear transformations in matrix form.
Properties of affine transformations:
- an n-dimensional object is mapped to an n-dimensional object, a point to a point, a line to a line, a surface to a surface.
- the parallelism of lines and planes is preserved.
- the proportions of parallel objects are preserved (lengths of segments on parallel lines and areas on parallel planes).
These properties make it possible to build prototypes of polygons on a plane and polyhedra in space by a finite set of points - their vertices.
Affine transformations of three kinds are the basis for moving images:
- displacement/displacement
- scaling (increase/decrease)
- turning the corner -->
