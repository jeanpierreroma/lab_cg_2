            <span>What is fractal?</span>
            <p>A fractal is a complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems â€“ the pictures of Chaos. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc.</p>
            <span>What is Mandelbrot fractal?</span>
            <p>The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z)=z*z+c does not diverge to infinity when iterated from z=0, i.e., for which the sequence f(0), f(f(0)) , remains bounded in absolute value.
                Images of the Mandelbrot set exhibit an elaborate and infinitely complicated boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications; mathematically, one would say that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is a fractal curve.</p>
